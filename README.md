doubts:

    Should I use another class to have an operation on item class.
    because  Item has a behaviour of updating itself does'nt seems right.
    What does this gilded rose class mean?
    Why do we have a list ther?


TODO :

    1. Name all conditions.  -- done -- better naming not done
    2. Don't pass the item to item class.
    3. Remove static method
    4. Make arrray to list
